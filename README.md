* Contradictory Text Analysis is a crucial NLP task involving identifying contradictions or entailment relationships in textual data. This project utilizes the ”Contradictory, My Dear Watson” data-set to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying sentence pairs as contrastive, neutral, or implicative. The model, based on RNNs or transformer-based architectures, captures contextual information and sequential dependencies. Training on the annotated dataset, it learns to classify sentence pairs. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score assess the model’s performance.This project aims to enhance breast cancer detection accuracy in medical imaging and improve analysis of contradictory text using advanced deep learning tools.

* We consider all the languages
* Our dataset is too low, so we are using [multi_nli](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_nli) dataset to extends our data for traning data
* And some important EDA
